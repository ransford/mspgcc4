To build a certain version of MSPGCC4, ensure that you have the "dialog"
package installed (optional), and run the "buildgcc.pl" script.

NOTE! Stripping output binaries assumes that only mspgcc and related
material installed by this script will be found under the given prefix.
Other executables will also be stripped without further notice!
